### Step 1: Set Up a New React Project

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New React App**: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React application using Create React App:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app production-dashboard
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd production-dashboard
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

You will need to install `Chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` for charting:

```bash
npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
```
### Step 3: Run the Application

Now that everything is set up, you can run your React application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you should see your production dashboard in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Conclusion

You have successfully converted the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content into a functional React application. You can further enhance the application by implementing real-time data fetching, improving the charting functionality, and adding more features as needed.
